# Caesar-cipher
This repository contains a simple Caesar cipher program written in Python. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.

## Features

- Encrypts and decrypts text using a specified shift value.
- Handles shifts greater than 26 by using modulo arithmetic.
- Retains numbers, symbols, and spaces in the input text.
- Allows users to restart the program to encrypt/decrypt multiple messages.
